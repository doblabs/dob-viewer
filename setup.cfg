# So that the user can call `flake8`, maintain an exclude list. (Another way
# to lint is via `make lint` or `tox -e flake8`, which call flake8 on exact
# paths, e.g., `flake8 setup.py source/ tests/`. Here we achieve same effect
# but by doing the opposite, being exclusive rather than inclusive.)

#
# - Project-agnostic, universal behavior (that supports and enforces this
#   and similar projects' style guides, i.e., this developer's preferences):
#
#   - ✓ W391: blank line at end of file
#
#       - (lb): Personal preference. So that, e.g., Vim's <C-End> is predictable
#               and goes to first column of an empty last line, rather than to
#               some unknown last column of a nonempty last line.
#
#   - ✓ W503 line break before binary operator
#
#       - (lb): I'm with Knuth, for readability, because columns align.
#
#               Prefer this:
#
#                   if (some_thing
#                       and another
#                       and another_thing):
#
#               over this:
#
#                   if (some_thing and
#                       another and
#                       another_thing):
#
# - Project- and dependency-specific, less common options:
#
#   - ✗ W605 invalid escape sequence:
#
#       - Specific to some Click library usage.
#         - (lb): Was warned on regex, e.g., '\d{2}' was flagged.
#         - (lb): Was warned on escape in Click help string, e.g., 'blah \# blah'.
